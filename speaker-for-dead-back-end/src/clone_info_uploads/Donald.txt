New York City real estate developer and reality TV star Donald Trump (1946- ) served as America’s 45th president from January 2017-January 2021. The billionaire businessman ran as a Republican and scored an upset victory over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election. 

Trump began his career working for his father’s real estate development firm, taking over its leadership in the 1970s. In the ensuing decades, he acquired and built hotels, office towers, casinos and golf courses and also appeared on 14 seasons of “The Apprentice.” He was the first person ever elected to the U.S. presidency without any previous government or military experience. On December 18, 2019, Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives. On January 13, 2021, he became the only president in U.S. history to be impeached a second time.

On March 30, 2023, Trump became the first former president to be charged with a crime when a Manhattan grand jury voted to indict him on charges related to hush money payments.
